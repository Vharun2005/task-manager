## About the Project
The **Todo App** is a React.js application designed for managing tasks effectively. It offers CRUD functionality and enables users to sort tasks based on priority levels and creation date. All data is stored locally in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring persistence between sessions.

---

## Features
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks**: Full CRUD operations to manage tasks.
- **Priority-Based Sorting**: Tasks can be sorted by priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
- **Creation Date Sorting**: View tasks in the order of their creation.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Data is saved in the browser, so it persists after refreshes or reopens.
